# Parsa Summer 2024

## My work in LyRL

### 1. **bpac.py**
- **Purpose**: Implements the method outlined in the [referenced paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.11008) to compute PAC-Bayes bounds.
- **Model**: Applies to a 2-layer fully connected neural network.
- **Dataset**: Trained on the MNIST dataset.

### 2. **model.py**
- **Purpose**: Trains a 2-layer fully connected neural network.
- **Dataset**: Trained on the MNIST dataset.


### 2. **kfac.py**
- **Purpose**: Implements the results of the paper [does the data induce capacity control in deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14163).
- **Dataset**: Trained on the MNIST dataset.
